## Humility - Simple Enchants

### Description
This is a small mod that adds couple easy to understand enchantments. <br>
<br>
### Added enchants: <br>
Frost (1 - 2) - opposite of Fire Aspect, slows mobs on impact as well as extinguishes them. <br>
(Obtainable through enchanting table) <br>
Destruction (1 - 3) - Mine blocks in 3x3x{level} radius, but none of the blocks will drop. <br>
When alongside Silk Touch there will be a chance for the blocks to drop (increased by destruction enchantment level). <br>
(Obtainable through enchanting table) <br>
<br>
### Added Curses: <br>
Curse of Decay - Mobs always drop rotten flesh instead of other kinds of meats. <br>
(Obtainable through, low bookshelf count, enchanting table or from various dungeons) <br>
